<p>
Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the<br> 
English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of<br> 
the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making<br> 
him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development<br> 
in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.<br> 
AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly<br> 
extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
